          <p>
            Hi, I’m Euan! I’m someone who loves exploring worlds—whether it’s through open-world games, coding new ideas, or getting lost in a great anime. Gaming is my go-to escape, especially anything that lets me roam freely and discover new adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also passionate about coding and enjoy building things that challenge me creatively and logically. Outside the screen, I love staying active through sports. Overall, I’m a mix of curiosity, creativity, and a love for fun, immersive experiences.

              <p>
                I’m all about gyming, gaming, and coding—three things that keep me balanced and excited every day. Whether I’m lifting, leveling up in a game, or building something new through code, I love pushing myself and improving a little more with each step.
